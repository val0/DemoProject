My suggestion if you are using msysgit client, set git executable for cmd in path of enviroment.
Set System Variable:GIT_HOME=C:\msysgit\msysgit
Add to end of Path:;%GIT_HOME%\cmd
// Verify that git client in Path set right
Open Command prompt and enter "git"
git will print help for all git commands. If not, set correct GIT_HOME and add it in Path

// First you need to tell git your name, so that it can properly label the commits you make.
git config --global user.name "Valeriy Garnitskiy"

// Git saves your email address into the commits you make. We use the email address to associate your commits with your GitHub account.
git config --global user.email "releng@emc.com"

C:\Users\garniv>mkdir .ssh
